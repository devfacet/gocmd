# Contributing

- Code contributions must be through pull requests.
- Run tests, linting and formatting before a pull request.
- Pull requests can not be merged without being reviewed.
- Use "Issues" for bug reports, feature requests and discussions.
- Do not refactor existing code without a discussion.
- Do not add a new third party dependency without a discussion.
- Use semantic versioning and git tags for versioning.
